<b>WARNINGS:</b>

* If you find blank text files in the SORR subfolders, do not delete them, as they are created by the program to identify mod installations.
* Do not delete the folder of an installed mod. Uninstall it first and then delete your folder.
* Don't edit the program and respective add-ons if you don't understand Batch Script.
* It's recommended that you don't change the files in the SORR folder and subfolders while a mod is installed.
* When replacing the program and add-ons with a new version, uninstall all mods and chars first.
* If you find a bug, please report it on a post of the program.
* There won't be a support for all mods.
